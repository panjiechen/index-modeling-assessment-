the total return formula in the model is: total retun Index= prvious total return *(today's return/prvious's return) 
divdend is not considered in the model due to lacking of divdend information 
the total return of first day every month should choose the same stock plan as last month, however from the second day to the last business day of the month, the stock plan based on the face value of the last business of the last month.
pandas==1.4.4 
some results may have mirror difference due to rounding but the result should be correct( for example, 92.74 and 92.73 due to rounding) 
sorry to send this model on Thursday (EST) due to busy work those days

Thank you
